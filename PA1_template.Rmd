# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
stepspds <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, FUN=sum, na.rm = TRUE, na.action = na.pass)
barplot(stepspds$steps, main="Number of steps taken each day", xlab="Date", ylab="Steps", names.arg=stepspds$date)
```
_Please note that there is several day with zero steps values._

### Mean and median total number of steps taken per day
_Days with no values for steps was also included in this calculation as days with zero steps values._
```{r}
mn <- as.integer(mean(stepspds$steps))
md <- as.integer(median(stepspds$steps))
```
The __mean__ of the total number of steps taken per day is __`r mn`__ and the __median__ is __`r md`__.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
stepspim <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data=activity, FUN=mean, na.rm = TRUE, na.action = na.pass)
plot(stepspim, type="l", main="Number of steps taken per inteval, averaged across all days")
```

__Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?__
```{r}
maxint <- stepspim$interval[which.max(stepspim$steps)]
```
The __`r maxint`__ interval contains the maximum number of steps on average across all the days in the dataset.

## Imputing missing values

### The total number of missing values in the dataset 
```{r}
nassum <- sum(is.na(activity))
```
The total number of missing values in the dataset is __`r nassum`__. 

### My strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset

I decided to use the means for the 5-minute intervals (averaged across all days) to  fill the missing values.

### New dataset with the missing data filled in
```{r}
activityf <- merge(activity, stepspim, by="interval", suffixes=c("", ".y"))
isnas <- is.na(activityf$steps)
activityf$steps[isnas] <- activityf$steps.y[isnas]
activityf$steps.y = NULL ##drop column
```

### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day for new dataset 
```{r}
stepspdsf <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activityf, FUN=sum)
bp<-barplot(stepspdsf$steps, main="Number of steps taken each day for new dataset", xlab="Date", ylab="Steps", 
            names.arg=stepspdsf$date)
```

### Mean and median total number of steps taken per day for new dataset
```{r}
mnf <- as.integer(mean(stepspdsf$steps))
mdf <- as.integer(median(stepspdsf$steps))
```
The __mean__ of the total number of steps taken per day for new dataset is __`r mnf`__ and the __median__ is __`r mdf`__.

These values are really differ from the estimates for initial data set: __`r mn`__ and the __`r md`__.

The new values are bigger since there is now no days with zero values which bias the initial estimation of mean and median. Such calculation seems more correct.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
I have created a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
activityf$weekdaytype <- factor(weekdays(as.Date(activityf$date)) %in% c( "Saturday",  "Sunday"), 
                                levels=c("FALSE", "TRUE"), 
                                labels=c("weekday", "weekend"))

```

Below is the panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days and weekend days (y-axis).
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))

##weekdays
stepsptmwd <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data=activityf, subset=activityf$weekdaytype=="weekday", FUN=mean)
plot(stepsptmwd, type="l", main="Averaged across all Weekday days")

##weekends
stepsptmwd <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data=activityf, subset=activityf$weekdaytype=="weekend", FUN=mean)
plot(stepsptmwd, type="l", main="Averaged across all Weekend days")

```
From this figure is clearly seen that there is some differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends.
